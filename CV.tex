\textbf{Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.}\\
Advisor: \textbf{Ron Milo}, Assistant Professor.\\
Metabolic engineering and synthetic biology to increase the natural growth rate of the bacteria \textit{E. coli} on the highly oxidized glyoxylate molecule as part of a more general effort of designing an autotrophic organism from a heterotrophic backbone.\\

{\small\addfontfeature{Color=lightgray}June 2012 - June 2013}}\\
\textbf{California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA.}\\
Advisor: \textbf{Rob Phillips}, Fred and Nancy Morris Professor of Biophysics and Biology.\\
Implementation of a thermodynamic model of gene regulation in the wild type lac operon to explore the variability in the regulation of this genetic circuit; mapping changes in the DNA bases into changes in the parameters of the model and predicting the corresponding phenotypic changes. By analyzing \textit{E. coli} natural isolates from all over the world we explored the natural variability of this genetic circuit among different isolates from the same species.\\

\section{teaching experience}
Teacaher assistant - BE/Bi103: Data Analysis in the Biological Sciences.\\
Description: Modern biology is a quantitative science, and biologists need to be equipped with tools to analyze quantitative data. This course takes a hands-on approach to developing these tools. Among other techniques, we show how to do regression, parameter estimation, outlier detection and correction, error estimation, hypothesis testing, denoising, and image processing and quantification.\\
Duration: 10 weeks.\\
{\addfontfeature{Color=lightgray}California Institute of Technology, 2015}\\

Instructor - ``Biolog\'{i}a a trav\'{e}s de los n\'{u}meros" (biology by the numbers).\\
Description: Intense biophysics bootcamp to introduce senior high-school students, 1st \& 2nd year undergraduate students to the current challenges in quantitative biology.\\
Duration: 1 week\\
{\addfontfeature{Color=lightgray}Clubes de Ciencia Mexico. Ensenada Baja California, 2014}\\

Teacher assistant - Bi1X: The great ideas of biology, an introduction through experimentation.\\
Description: Bi1x provides students with an introduction to concepts and laboratory methods in biology. Molecular biology techniques and advanced microscopy were combined to explore the great ideas of biology.\\
Duration: 10 weeks\\
{\addfontfeature{Color=lightgray}California Institute of Technology, 2013}\\

\section{extracurricular activities}
\textbf{Cubes de Ciencia Mexico. Organization committee}\\
The emerging non-profit association Clubes de Ciencia Mexico aims to expand the access of young Mexican students to high quality scientific education. For this we design and implement science, technology, engineering and math workshops for high school students and freshman undergrads. Our science clubs are the mechanism to establish a network of mentors that link the most prominent young scientists in Mexico and abroad with other Mexican students interested in science. This international network of mentors tries to catalyze three main objectives:\\
(1) Increase the interest for science among the students.\\
(2) Guide young students towards scientific careers.\\
(3) Develop science-related technical and cognitive abilities.
